<# SNOWTAM & MOTNE Cheat sheet

### SNOWTAM
Runways are listed with their lowest numbered threshold. This means that for example reports for RWY29 are to be interpreted from reading RWY11's report, reading RWY thirds backwards.

* A) Aerodrome
* B) Time of issuing: MMDDHHmm (UTC)
* C) Runways for this report
* D) Cleared RWY length (if less than published)
* E) Cleared RWY width (if less than published)
* F) Deposits for each third  
	Listing represents layers from top to bottom, e.g. 67 represents Slush on top of ice
	* 1 = Damp
 	* 2 = Wet or water patches
 	* 3 = Rime or frost (<1 mm)
 	* 4 = Dry snow
 	* 5 = Wet snow
 	* 6 = Slush
 	* 7 = Ice
 	* 8 = Compact or rolled snow
 	* 9 = Frozen ruts or ridges
 	* NIL = Clear and dry
* G) Average depth in mm for each third
* H) Measured/Estimated friction  
If measured: two digits  
If estimated: one digit
9 = Unreliable
If friction was measured, the type of equipment is specified (e.g. GRT for grip tester or RFT for runway friction tester)  
* J) Critical snowbanks, listed in form H/DS:
	* H = height [cm]
	* D = distance from edge [m]
	* S = Side, can be L, R or LR
* K) RWY lights, if obscured. Followed by L, R or LR
* M) Expected time of further clearance to be completed
* N) Associated TWY conditions, not divided into thirds
* T) Clear text

### MOTNE
8 Digits appended to METAR: *AABCDDEE*

* AA: RWY designator
	* For parallel runways, R is designated by adding 50: 11L=11, 11R=61
	* 88 = All RWY
	* 99 = Prior RWY report repeated
* B: Type
 	* 0 = Clear and Dry
 	* 1 = Damp
 	* 2 = Wet or water patches
 	* 3 = Rime or frost (<1 mm)
 	* 4 = Dry snow
 	* 5 = Wet snow
 	* 6 = Slush
 	* 7 = Ice
 	* 8 = Compact or rolled snow
 	* 9 = Frozen ruts or ridges
 	* / = Not reported
* C: Extent
	* 1 = â‰¤ 10% covered
	* 2 = 11% to 25% covered
	* 5 = 26% to 50% covered
	* 9 = 51% to 100% covered
	* / = Not reported
* DD: Depth
	* 00 = < 1 mm
	* 01 - 90 = depth in mm
	* 92 = 10 cm
	* 93 = 15 cm
	* 94 = 20 cm
	* 95 = 25 cm
	* 96 = 30 cm
	* 97 = 35 cm
	* 98 = 40 cm
	* 99 = Not reported: **RWY not operational**
	* // = Not significant or measurable
* EE: Braking condition  
	01 - 90 = **Friction Coefficient** multiplied by 100: e.g. 05 = 0.05  
	91 - 95 = **Braking action** :
	* 91 = Poor
	* 92 = Medium/Poor
	* 93 = Medium
	* 94 = Medium/Good
	* 95 = Good
	
	99 = Unreliable  
	// = Not reported: **RWY not operational**
	
### Contamination definitions
As defined by ICAO

* Damp: the surface shows a change of colour due to moisture
* Wet: the surface is soaked but there is no standing water 
* Water patches: significant patches of standing water are visible
* Flooded: extensive standing water is visible
* Dry snow: Snow which can be blown if loose or, if compacted by hand, will fall apart again upon release
* Compacted snow: Snow which has been compressed into a solid mass that resists further compression and will hold together or break up into lumps if picked up
* Wet snow: Snow which, if compacted by hand, will stick together and tend to or form a snowball
* Slush: Water-saturated snow which with a heel-and-toe slap- down motion against the ground will be displaced with a splatter
